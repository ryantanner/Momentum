Momentum
======

A travel/weather mashup
-----------------------

This was a school project for a web applications class in which we (three CS students) were paired up with a project proposal by a business class.  They pitched, we built.  Yes, it's basic.  Yes, it's pretty simple.  It was a good way to get some quick experience with a few APIs (Google Maps, Wunderground) and Google App Engine.  We had some fun, spent a night or two in a comp-sci lab and all got A's.  Enjoy.

Functionality
-------------

* Provide directions via Google Maps based on user's destination and starting point
* Auto-locates the user's current location if desired
* Chooses eight equidistant points along the route and places these as markers on the map.  These points provide weather information along the user's proposed route.
