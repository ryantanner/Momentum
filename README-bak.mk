To any who may stumble upon this:

This was a school project for a web applications class in which we (three CS students) were paired up with a project proposal by a business class.  They pitched, we built this.  Yes, it's basic.  Yes, it's pretty simple.  It was a good way to get some quick experience with a few APIs (Google Maps, Wunderground) and Google App Engine.  We had some fun, spent a night or two in a comp-sci lab and all got A's.  Enjoy.  

--Functionality
----Provide directions via Google Maps, user input destination and deparature
----Choose eight equidistant points along the route and place these points as
		markers on the google map. In turn, these points when scrolled over will
		generate a pop-up that contains current weather conditions at that area.
